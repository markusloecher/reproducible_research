### Why is reproducible research important?

Evidence of correctness

An obvious reason for reproducing research and repeating analyses is to confirm that the original results are indeed correct. 
When another scientist reproduces your research and comes to the same conclusion, it is more likely that the conclusion is 
correct. The same goes for negative results, where reproducing the analysis can confirm if they are erroneous or statistically 
insignificant.
